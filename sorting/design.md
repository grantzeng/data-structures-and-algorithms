### Sorts to know
quadratic sorts
- selection sort
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- shell sort

nlogn sorts
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort

linear sorts
- radix sort


Implement all of them today (2024-01-31) to convince yourself of correctness of the algorithms, then comeback to time complexity and other performance issues/trade-offs between them later

### Open issues
`bubble_sort`: What's going on with the inner loop being set as `range(n- i - 1)`? Why not just `range(n-1)`?

Comeback analyse/prove correctness, time complexity and other tradeoffs to consider

Merge sort - can we do an inplace implementation on an array?
