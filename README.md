# data-structures-and-algorithms

### Current plan

Data structures:
- Implement all the basic data structures (practical understanding of trade-offs, correctness)
    - Prototyping in Python (I'm trying to focus on grokking correctness of algorithms, e.g. why is it _obvious_ that `subtree_delete()` is correct?)
    - Key data structures topics:
        - set vs. sequence interface, ADTs etc.
            - stacks, queues, dicts as restricted versions
        - linked list
        - dynamic array
        - binary search tree
        - hash table
        - self-balancing binary search trees
        - heap/priority queue
        - tries
- Go back and look at the formal analysis of performance
- Graph representations
- (More exotic data structures that might turn up e.g. B-trees etc, but these are not priority)

Algorithms:
- Practical:
    - start with sorting, CLRS Ch2
- Theoretical:
    - revise Landau notation + solving recurrences

    - Algorithm design strategies:
        - greedy method
        - network flow problems
        - dynamic programming
        - string matching problems
        - linear programming
        - intractable problems and _approximation algorithms_ (interesting and useful)
