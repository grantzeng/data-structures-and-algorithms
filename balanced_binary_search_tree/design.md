# What operations do I need for an avl tree?

Basic tree operations
- insert
- delete
- find(k), find min, find max, successor, predecessor

Operations for maintaining height balance
- skew checking -> height checking
- left_rotate, right_rotate
- maintain balance (`)
- (also augment the data structure to maintain heights so not having to constantly recompute them)


I can't believe I've forgotten all this since 2521. Basically the essentials are (1) knowing about tree rotations and (2) knowing how/when to rebalance a tree to maintain h = O(logn), I think this is all the brainpower I have this afternoon to revise things.

Change of plan, have a proper working implementation of a binary tree first, before coming back to this.
